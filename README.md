This repository was made as part of recruitement test.
"Create a system for marking and navigating an isometric view map with a group of three (or more) characters, where movement commands are issued by clicking on the map with a mouse, and the selected character moves from point A to point B. The selected character becomes the leader for the following characters, who follow them. Each character has its own coefficients of speed, agility, and endurance, which are randomly generated at each startup of the prototype. Character selection should be possible by pressing one of three (or more) buttons on the canvas.

The code is readable and consistent.
The canvas supports different screen resolutions and formats appropriately.
The code is correctly committed to a public repository.
Instead of using built-in Navmesh AI, some form of custom implementation of the A* algorithm is used.
It is possible to save and read the map settings and coefficients to a file during gameplay.
Addressables are used.
Async and await are used (e.g., in file writing).
Preprocessor commands are used.
Interfaces are used."
